# Hacker-News
 This project is a simple web application built with Django that emulates the functionality of the popular news aggregator site, Hacker News. It allows users to submit and upvote news stories, as well as comment and discuss them. The site features a clean and minimalist design, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
