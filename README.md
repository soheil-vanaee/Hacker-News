# Django-based Hacker News clone
 This project is a simple web application built with Django that emulates the functionality of the popular news aggregator site, Hacker News. It allows users to submit and upvote news stories, as well as comment and discuss them. The site features a clean and minimalist design, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.


The code is written in Python and follows the Django framework conventions. It uses various Django modules such as authentication, ORM, forms, and views, as well as third-party libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery for the front-end. The project is fully documented and includes instructions for setting up and running the application locally.

Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute to the project. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
